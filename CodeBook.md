Time Domain
  Measured in time
  
Frequency Domain
  FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) was applied to the signal
  
Body
  Body measurement
  
Gravity
  Gravity measurement
  
Acceleration
  Measured in linear acceleration
  
Gyroscope
  Measure in angular velocity
  
X, Y, Z Axis
  Indicates which axis the measurement was from
  
Jerking Motion
  Indicates the measurement is dervied from the velocity of the motion
  
Magnitude
  Indicates the measurement is derived from the the magnitude of the the 3-dimensional signals using the Euclidean norm

Mean
  The measurement is the arthimetic mean of the signal

Standard Deviation
  The measurement is the standard deviation of the signal

Example:
"frequency domain body acceleration mean on the x axis"
=
This column is the arithmetic mean of the signal taken from the body acceleration along the x axis, with FFT applied to the signal.
